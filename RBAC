The video is about Kubernetes RBAC. The speaker, Abhishek, starts by explaining what Kubernetes RBAC is and why it is important. He then goes over the two main parts of Kubernetes RBAC: users and service accounts. He explains how to create users and service accounts, and then goes over the three main resources for managing RBAC: roles, cluster roles, and role bindings.
