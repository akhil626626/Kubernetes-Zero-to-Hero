Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform.

Problems with container.

1. Single host
2. Auto healing. For example, one person in the company, by mistake deleted the pod. they we need to manually up the pod. If we have 
1000 of docker images it impossible  to monitor.
3. Autoscaling.
4. Docker doesn't have enterprise-level support.


like security, load balancer, API gateway, firewall etc.
